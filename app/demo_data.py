"""
Synthetic seed data for DEMO_MODE (security hardening).

A fixed set of emails shown to public demo visitors instead of a real
inbox. Seven are original, written to exercise the ordinary
actionable/not-actionable cases this project's own evaluation set already
covers (phase1_extraction/test_emails.jsonl has the same flavor). The
other three are carried over verbatim from
phase1_extraction/adversarial_test_emails.jsonl — two instruction-injection
attempts (adv-1, adv-2) and one spoofed-sender case modeled on the
project's actual candidate id=9 incident (adv-4) — specifically so a demo
visitor can see `injection_suspected` and `sender_trust_signal` fire for
real, on cases this project already hand-labeled and evaluated against,
not cherry-picked just for the demo.

Seeded once at startup (app/main.py) when DEMO_MODE is true, directly into
the `emails` table as if a scan had already run — demo mode never calls
the real Gmail API. Re-seeding is idempotent: existing message_ids are
skipped, same dedup rule app/routes_scan.py already uses for a real scan.
