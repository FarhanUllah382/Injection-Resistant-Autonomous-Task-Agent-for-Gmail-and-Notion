"""
Stored emails -> task_candidates.

Reuses the Phase 1 extractor unchanged. Deliberately stops at candidate
creation: no approval/edit logic and no Notion sync here (see CLAUDE.md
build order — those are separate phases). Synchronous, single request,
one email at a time — no background worker.

Ahead of extraction, each email passes through Triage (app/triage.py) —
a deterministic pre-filter, no LLM call (Design Decisions V2.2). Only
obviously non-actionable emails are skipped; extraction_prompt.py and
extractor.py are otherwise reached exactly as in V2.1, unchanged.

Each actionable candidate also gets a shadow-mode policy_decision (Design
Decisions V2.3, Decisions 1-2 & 4) via app/policy.py — computed and
stored for later reporting, but never acted on: AUTO_ACT_ENABLED is False
(app/config.py), so `status` is always "pending" here, exactly as before
V2.3. See app/policy.py's docstring for why.

V2.4 adds two more inputs to that same policy call: `injection_suspected`
(from extraction_prompt.py's output — see app/policy.py) and
sender_trust_signal (app/sender_trust.py), computed alongside triage,
before extraction, same as V2.2's should_triage_out(). Both are hard
overrides in compute_policy(), not new triage rules — triage itself
(app/triage.py) is untouched.

V2.5 (Design Decisions V2.5, Decision 4) fetches any active correction
notes once per /extract call — they don't vary within a batch — and
passes the same list into every extractor.extract() call below.
extractor.py itself never touches the database (Decision 4); this route
is the caller responsible for that. compute_policy()'s call is completely
unchanged from V2.4 — correction notes are never passed to it (Decision 2).

V2.6 (Design Decisions V2.6, Decisions 3-4) resolves a candidate's
`proposed_meeting_time` (app/meeting_time_resolver.py) and, if resolved,
runs the Scheduling Agent (app/scheduling.py) once at creation time —
same "compute once, store, display later" convention as policy_decision
(V2.3). This is a read-only calendar check; nothing here ever books
anything (Decision 5 — that's app/routes_scheduling.py's job, and
nowhere else). If the account hasn't granted Calendar scope, or the check
fails for any other reason, calendar_status is set to "unavailable" and
extraction/candidate-creation proceeds exactly as before (Decision 2) —
never raised as an ExtractionError.

V2.6 scheduling correction: a time-bearing deadline (e.g. "5 PM this
Friday") is also a scheduling input, not just an explicit meeting
proposal — see _resolve_scheduling_input() below. `proposed_meeting_time`
stays strictly primary; the deadline is only tried as a fallback when no
meeting was proposed. `deadline_resolved`/`resolved_due_date` themselves
are computed exactly as before via app/deadline_resolver.py (now fixed to
correctly resolve time-bearing phrases to a date — see that module) —
nothing about compute_policy()'s inputs or app/policy.py's rules changes
here beyond that resolver bug fix flowing through as intended.

V2.7 (Design Decisions V2.7): the actual extraction logic now lives in
run_extract(), a plain function taking a Session instead of `Depends`, so
app/scheduler.py's automatic poll can call the exact same code a manual
POST /extract already did (Decision 1's "no logic duplication" principle,
same pattern as run_scan() in app/routes_scan.py). Two additive changes
inside the existing candidate-creation block, nothing else touched:
1. injection_suspected/sender_trust — already computed here to feed
   compute_policy() and previously discarded afterward — are now also
   stored directly on the candidate, so the review UI can show a distinct
   "flagged" badge for a V2.4 override specifically, instead of lumping it
   in with every other review_required candidate (V2.7 Decision 7 item 3).
2. A `new_candidate` event is published via app/events.py's in-process bus
   right after a candidate is committed, for the review UI's SSE toast/badge
   (V2.7 Decision 5). Nothing about what gets computed or decided changes.
