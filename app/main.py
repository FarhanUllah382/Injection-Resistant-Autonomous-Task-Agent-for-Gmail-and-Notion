"""
FastAPI app entry point.

Single process — see CLAUDE.md V1 architectural constraints. V2.7 (Design
Decisions V2.7, Decision 1) adds the one deliberate, user-confirmed
exception to that doc's "no background workers" default: an in-process
APScheduler job (app/scheduler.py) that calls the same run_scan()/
run_extract() functions POST /scan and POST /extract already call, just on
a ~2-minute timer instead of a click. Still one process, still no new
service/port/container — just a scheduled call inside the process that was
already running. Run with: uvicorn app.main:app --reload
