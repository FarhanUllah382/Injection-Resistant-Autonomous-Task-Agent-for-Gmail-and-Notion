"""
Automatic Gmail polling (Design Decisions V2.7, Decisions 1-2).

An in-process APScheduler job calls the exact same run_scan()/run_extract()
functions a manual POST /scan + POST /extract already call (app/routes_scan.py,
app/routes_extract.py) — same pipeline, same triage/policy/sender-trust/
Calendar-check behavior, just triggered on a timer instead of a click. This
is the one deliberate, user-confirmed exception to CLAUDE.md's "no background
workers" V1 default (see app/main.py's docstring) — V2.7's entire purpose is
turning manual-trigger scanning into automatic scanning.

Concurrency (Decision 2): APScheduler's default max_instances=1 on a job
means a still-running poll causes the next tick to be skipped rather than
overlapping — made explicit below rather than relied on silently.

Failure safety (Decision 2): a failed poll is logged, not surfaced as an
error, and simply retried next interval — except after 3 consecutive
failures, where the interval backs off to a fixed 10-minute floor
(BACKOFF_INTERVAL_SECONDS, not derived from the normal interval — see
app/config.py's GMAIL_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS) until a poll succeeds again,
to avoid hammering a Gmail API that's genuinely having trouble. If a
failure looks like an OAuth/token problem specifically (as opposed to a
transient network/API error), a single "reconnect Gmail" prompt is
published via app/events.py — debounced to once per failure episode, not
once per retry, so the user isn't spammed with the same prompt every 10
minutes while it's unresolved.

Known gap, documented rather than silently assumed correct: auth-failure
detection below is a best-effort string match. mcp_servers/gmail_mcp/server.py
doesn't wrap refresh errors the way notion_mcp/calendar_mcp do (return
{"error": ...}) — they propagate through FastMCP and app/mcp_clients.py's
unwrap() as a bare RuntimeError, so there's no typed exception to catch.
The exact text Google's real RefreshError produces hasn't been confirmed
against an actually-revoked token (V2.7 Decision 9 point 2 — deliberately
not tested against a real account as part of this implementation). Worst
case if the string doesn't match: an auth failure is treated as a generic
quiet failure (still gets the 10-minute backoff) rather than surfacing the
specific "reconnect Gmail" prompt — fails safe, not silently wrong.
