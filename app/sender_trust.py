"""
Sender-trust signal (Design Decisions V2.4, Decision 3).

Deterministic, header-only signal computed before extraction, alongside
Triage (V2.2) — no LLM call. This is a separate signal from Triage: Triage
decides whether an email reaches extraction at all; this decides how much
the *policy* (app/policy.py) should trust an email that does reach and
pass extraction. Feeds compute_policy() as a hard override (Decision 4) —
never triage itself, which stays untouched.

Targets the failure candidate id=9 exposed under V2.3: a well-formed,
high-confidence request whose actual problem was sender identity, not
content — content-level defenses (extraction_prompt.py's
injection_suspected) cannot catch that; only a sender-identity signal can.

Implementation note (empirically verified — see the Decision 6 adversarial
run): the doc's illustrative example is an org-name pattern ("Acme Legal
<random123@gmail.com>"), but candidate id=9's actual sender was
"SARKAR Y,T" <syt96868@gmail.com> — not org-sounding, but formatted like
an auto-generated corporate-directory name (ALL-CAPS surname + comma-
separated initials) on a personal webmail domain, with no textual link
between the name and the address. A keyword-only reading of "professional-
sounding" would not have caught id=9 at all. `_looks_professional` below
therefore checks both patterns: organizational/role keywords, OR
corporate-directory-style name formatting.
